Solution Description/Explanation:
In this program, I created a pipeline into a Logistic Regression model to predict/classify a mushroom as poisonous or edible.
I used functions from the sklearn model_selection, linear_model, preprocessing, and pipeline libraries. I split the data into 80% training and 20% testing.
The data was preprocessed using the OneHotEncoder function in order to handle a ValueError regarding conversion of a string to a float that occurred when training the model.

- I referenced code that was used in the course exercises as a review to recall the functions used and how to handle certain errors.
